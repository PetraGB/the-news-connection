  "target" : "article1",
  "content" : "<h2>Is there a difference between a migrant and a refugee?</h2>A migrant is a person who leaves home to seek a new life in another region or country. This includes all those who move across borders, including those doing so with government permission, i.e., with a visa or a work permit, as well as those doing so without it, i.e., irregular or undocumented migrants. The member states of the European Union agree that EU citizens and their families have freedom of movement within the EU and the European Economic Area\u2014these citizens are privileged migrants because they don\u2019t require individual permission from officials as other migrants do.</br></br>A refugee is someone fleeing war, persecution, or natural disaster. Refugee status is defined in international law, which requires states to protect refugees and not send anyone to a place where they risk being persecuted or seriously harmed. States hold primary responsibility for the protection of refugees. <a target='_blank' href='http://www.unhcr.org/uk/figures-at-a-glance.html'>The UN counted 21.3 million refugees worldwide at the end of 2015 </a>.</br></br>\u201cAsylum\u201d refers to the legal permission to stay somewhere as a refugee, which brings rights and benefits. Not every asylum seeker will ultimately be recognized as a refugee, but every refugee is initially an asylum seeker.</br></br><h2>What is the European Union\u2019s asylum policy?</h2>The EU Common European Asylum System (CEAS) is a set of EU laws, completed in 2005. They are intended to ensure that all EU member states protect the rights of asylum seekers and refugees. The CEAS sets out minimum standards and procedures for processing and deciding asylum applications, and for the treatment of both asylum seekers and those who are recognized as refugees. Implementation of CEAS varies throughout the European Union. A number of EU states still do not operate fair, effective systems of asylum decision-making and support, leading to a patchwork of 28 asylum systems producing uneven results.</br></br>Asylum seekers have no legal duty to claim asylum in the first EU state they reach, and many move on, seeking to join relatives or friends for support, or to reach a country with a functioning asylum system. However, the <a target='_blank' href='https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/examination-of-applicants_en'>\u201cDublin\u201d regulation</a> stipulates that EU member states can choose to return asylum seekers to their country of first entry to process their asylum claim, so long as that country has an effective asylum system.</br></br>EU countries in the north, the desired destination of many refugees, have sought to use this Dublin system to their advantage, at the expense of the south, where most refugees first arrive. Yet these efforts have been obstructed by failures of asylum systems in the south. Domestic and European courts have ruled against asylum seekers being returned to Greece, notably in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.asylumlawdatabase.eu/en/content/ecthr-mss-v-belgium-and-greece-gc-application-no-3069609'>a landmark case</a> in 2011 that found Belgium in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights for exposing an Afghan national to detention, harsh living conditions, and risks arising from shortcomings in Greece's asylum system after a return.</br></br>To address the uneven application of CEAS and the problems of the Dublin system, a reform of the CEAS was proposed in 2016. Among <a target='_blank' href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2433_en.htm'>the proposed reforms</a> is one that risks endangering the right to asylum in the EU, with an obligation to verify first if asylum seekers could find protection outside the EU. Some EU countries have already voiced opposition to some of the reforms, notably the obligation to take refugees from other EU countries.</br></br><h2>Are asylum seekers and migrants still attempting to reach Europe?</h2>The majority of arrivals to the European Union in 2016 have come via the Mediterranean. Since the beginning of the year, more than <a target='_blank' href='https://missingmigrants.iom.int/mediterranean'>4,600 people</a> have died or gone missing while attempting to reach Italy from the North African coast. This is the highest recorded number of deaths in the Mediterranean to date.</br></br>The highest number of migrants arrive in Greece and Italy, often after a perilous journey across the sea. In Greece, around 62,000 people are waiting to have their asylum applications processed, with about 11,400 of them held in facilities on the Greek islands. Each month, less than 1,000 asylum decisions are given, with more than that number of asylum seekers arriving. In Italy, over 11,000 people per month applied for asylum in 2016, and on average between 6,000 and 8,000 are processed every month. Faced with this unprecedented situation, both countries have struggled to provide decent reception facilities with even basic services.</br></br><h2>How has the European Union responded to refugee movements?</h2>In 2015, high numbers of migrants, many of them Syrians fleeing conflict, continued to move. Some European states, led by Germany, recognized that their strategy of seeking to block refugees moving across borders was unrealistic and harmful. Countries worked together to allow migrants to move onwards to the places they wished to reach. This allowed reception countries to focus their resources on supporting asylum seekers and considering claims.</br></br>By early 2016, support for this policy began to wane, with increased hostility towards migrants entering the political discourse. Certain countries along the migrant route began to close their borders. The situation further deteriorated when the EU\u2019s decision to transfer 160,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to other European member states was met with widespread resistance. <a target='_blank' href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-3614_en.htm'>In the end, a small percentage of the needed transfers actually took place.</a></br></br>In response to the failure to adequately process asylum claims, the EU set up \u201chotspots\u201d in Greece and Italy. Hotspots identify, register, and fingerprint incoming migrants, and redirect them either towards asylum or return procedures. In practice, many hotspots are turning into overcrowded and understaffed detention and expulsion centers, with little external oversight.</br></br>In March 2016, the EU announced a deal in which Turkey would try to stop people from moving onward into Europe; in return, Turkey was promised financial assistance, visa-free travel to the EU for Turkish citizens, and faster negotiations for EU accession. But the EU-Turkey deal failed to close the border, and thousands of migrants continued to travel irregularly using smugglers. Since the deal, only 750 asylum seekers have been sent back from Greece to Turkey, because <a target='_blank' href='https://www.proasyl.de/en/pressrelease/appeals-committee-on-lesbos-stops-deportations-to-turkey/'>Greek officials and courts consider Turkey to be an unsafe country.</a></br></br>This deal is one example of a controversial practice, in which the EU links development aid or economic incentives to commitments by states to stem and manage the movements of people from their territory. Similar deals are being approved with a number of third countries including Libya, Egypt, Sudan, and Nigeria. In June 2016, the European Commission proposed a new \u201cPartnership Framework\u201d with third countries in the Middle East and Africa, leading to criticism by a broad range of actors for deal-making with countries with poor human rights records, and for conflicting with international protection frameworks, including the right to leave one\u2019s own country.</br></br>The EU also continues to support refugees in host countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan\u2014where the majority of Syrian refugees are hosted\u2014including through funding for UN agencies working in the field such as the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.unhcr.org/uk/donors.html'>UNHCR</a> or the WFP.</br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-migration-and-asylum-european-union'>Open Society Foundations</a> </br> Date: December 2016",

  "target" : "article2",
  "content" : "It is quite possible to say that our world hasn't witnessed anything as shameful as what\u2019s happening today. Never before have millions of vulnerable children been left alone to face all sorts of dangers. </br></br>Today, 230 million children live in conflict zones and most of them get no help - and in most cases, not even a sideways glance - from that part of the world that is capable of helping. The world seems to be concerned with \u2018supposedly more important issues\u2019 like highly anticipated music albums, the latest fashion trends or sporting competitions. </br></br>Oddly, a big part of these children live in places where you wouldn't expect them to be in danger. Nonetheless, they are in danger and they are in the heart of Europe.</br></br>The Syrian War has destroyed a country and tore a whole nation apart, leaving millions without their families, homes, incomes or safety, as millions of Syrians had to look for a safe future elsewhere. As a result, 4.7 million Syrians are now refugees in other countries and there is simply nowhere left they can call home.</br></br>However, before the war, Syrians led decent lives just like us. They were regular people with normal lives. They were doctors, teachers, engineers; mothers, fathers, grandparents, and schoolchildren. They probably never imagined that someday their \u2018normal\u2019 lives would be shattered into pieces and that they would find themselves in positions no one would want to be in. Yet that is exactly what happened, and millions of Syrians have had to turn to others for help, even if those others are usually unsympathetic or even downright hostile towards them. You have certainly heard how droves of refugees constantly seek ways to reach Europe and embark on perilous \u2018death voyages\u2019. Many perish on the way but most of those who manage to set foot in Europe face shocking hostility, humiliation and rejection. An inexcusable \u2018we don't want you here, go back to where you came from\u2019 attitude is all too prevalent across Europe. Many of these downtrodden people are held in inhumane detention centers, including babies who sometimes have to sleep on the ground, and having to survive on a little amount of milk. Maybe worse, among these scores of people there are thousands of unaccompanied minors. You read that right; thousands of children without any adult supervision, completely exposed to all sorts of dangers. Their ages vary from 1 to 17.</br></br>Unpredictably, Europol recently reported 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children have now gone missing. Not one, ten, or a hundred children: 10,000 refugee children are missing. According to the authorities, they might have been taken by human traffickers, sex traders, or organ traffickers; as of this writing, no one is completely sure where they've disappeared to.</br></br>Europe is one of the richest continents in the world, with a sizable area more than enough to accommodate one million refugees. After all, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, with significantly less wealth when compared to Europe and with much less area, generously opened their doors and welcomed close to a 4.8 million refugees in an approach praised as \u2018the best example in the entire world\u2019. Turkey alone has spent some $10 billion for 2.7 million refugees without any foreign help, even though it has a GDP of only $10,500 per capita.</br></br>But Europe has a completely different story: Take the \u201cCalais Jungle\u201d in the heart of Europe, on the coast of France, for instance. There is a reason why this place is called a \u2018jungle\u2019. The situation in this so-called camp is so horrible, it doesn't seem fit for anyone, especially for the children. Recently, it was reported that teenage boys are being raped in the camp, but still no real measures are taken.   Night after night many children dangerously seek ways to go to the UK, sometimes by stowing or hiding away in trucks: Many die in the process. French police treat them brutally, teargas them or beat them up when they are caught. On top of this, British government last week rejected permission to allow 3,500 unaccompanied refugee children from camps in Europe to enter Britain.</br></br>Surely, there are exceptions in Europe, such as Sweden and Germany. Even though their efforts and help could be immensely larger given their economies and areas, their approach is laudable considering the attitude of the rest of Europe. In the same way, many European politicians, opinion leaders and Europeans adopt the same approach and promote enormous compassion for refugees. We hope that they will set a great example to the rest of their people and prove to the world once again that Europe is indeed a champion of human rights and a place of the highest standard of civilization and equality. </br></br> Source:<a target='_blank' href='http://ahtribune.com/world/north-africa-south-west-asia/refugee-crisis/1218-children-missing.html'> American Herald Tribute</a> </br> By: Harun Yahya</br> Date: September 24, 2016",

  "target" : "article3",
  "content" : "<img src='pics/3_1.jpg' width='800px'></br></br>Journalists aren\u2019t allowed inside Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. So, I probably never would have met Kamal Hassan if it hadn\u2019t been for the fire.</br></br>In September, refugees protesting the deplorable conditions in the camp <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-20/refugees-lose-little-they-have-left-lesbos-detention-center-blaze'>set much of it ablaze.</a> The 4,000 people living inside were forced to evacuate to the road outside the gates.</br></br>I was in the midst of the chaotic crowd with some other reporters when someone tapped me on the shoulder. A young man with friendly dark eyes introduced himself as Kamal Hassan. He told me he was a journalist from Somalia.  He and two other Somali journalists had come to Greece to seek asylum, he said, because they have each been targeted by the extremist group, al-Shabab, in Mogadishu.</br></br>But now they were stuck in Moria. And he urgently wanted to tell me their story.</br></br>Several days later, I returned to the camp, where Hassan introduced me to Yassin Abuukar and Kowthar Adraman.</br></br>The three journalists eagerly showed me their press IDs from Somali media outlets \u2014 Kalsan TV, Horn Cable TV and Radio, TV Mantaa and others. They were all under 30 and had been working as journalists in the Somali capital since their late teens. They had all been attacked by al-Shabab multiple times, they said. Their lives were in danger, so they had fled Somalia and come to Greece in hopes of getting asylum in Europe.</br></br>Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis make up the majority of the refugee population of 16,000 currently stuck on Lesbos and other Greek islands; African refugees are often overlooked. But in addition to the Somalis, Moria contains migrants from Sudan, Eritrea, Ghana, Congo, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Morocco, Egypt, Algeria, Mali, The Gambia and Uganda. Their desire is to gain permanent status as refugees or economic migrants in some European country \u2014 but their chances are slim.</br></br>Adraman is only 21. She says she's also the only female Somali journalist to have built and run her own news website \u2014 <a target='_blank'href='http://kowtharmedia.com/'>Kowtharmedia.com</a>, complete with her own theme song.</br></br>Working as a journalist in Somalia since she was 16 has made Adraman tough. Al-Shabab is known for targeting journalists in their homes, so to protect herself and her family, she lived in a safe house with other female journalists for the last five years. She would only see her mother once or twice a year.</br></br>\u201cNow [I'm fleeing] Somalia but before I left I had already had to flee from my family to keep them safe,\u201d she said.</br></br>But these precautions haven\u2019t shielded her from frequent death threats from al-Shabab by phone and text. She narrowly escaped injury in two bombing incidents, one at a cafe and one at a hotel in Mogadishu.</br></br>She left Somalia because she feared her time was running out.</br></br> <img src='pics/3_2.jpg' width='600px'></br></br>Somalia is one of the <a target='_blank' href='https://rsf.org/en/somalia'>most dangerous places</a> in the world to be a journalist. A failed state where extremists and criminal gangs operate with impunity, the country is ranked near the very bottom of the Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index.</br></br>The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks the country No. 1 on its <a target='_blank' href='https://cpj.org/reports/2016/10/impunity-index-getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php'>Global Impunity Index</a>, because so many journalists there are threatened and killed.</br></br>\u201cSomalia is extremely dangerous for anyone who conveys an opinion or a message that does not conform to the people with the guns,\u201d said journalist Murithi Mutiga, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Nairobi and the East Africa representative for CPJ.</br></br>Hassan was also threatened by al-Shabab. Like Adraman, he couldn\u2019t live at home. But one day, on a rare occasion when he was trying to visit his mother, he noticed suspicious men following him. They fired at him as he ran. He wasn\u2019t injured, but it was the last straw. He fled Somalia for Turkey, where he paid a smuggler to cross by dinghy to Greece.</br></br>In the boat, Hassan met Yassin Abuukar.</br></br>Abuukar\u2019s troubles started in 2008 when al-Shabab kidnapped him after he refused to work for their media outlet, Radio Koran. He was freed eventually, after his family paid a ransom. Later, he was captured again. He managed to escape the night before he was told he would be executed.</br></br>In 2012, he narrowly escaped death again, <a target='_blank' href='https://rsf.org/en/news/another-journalist-gunned-down-day-after-three-killed-suicide-bombing'>targeted by militants</a> in Mogadishu while he was working alongside prominent journalist Hassan Absuge. Abuukar got away; Absuge was murdered. Then last year, al-Shabab bombed the house where Abuukar\u2019s wife and child were living. Abuukar wasn\u2019t there, but his wife was injured, and his baby boy was killed.</br></br>That\u2019s when he decided to flee Somalia for good.</br></br>Abuukar, Hassan and Adraman hope to return to their country one day and continue working as journalists. Until then, their dream is to make it to London, which has a thriving Somali media scene. It\u2019s unlikely, though, that anyone here other than Syrians will be granted asylum.</br></br>For now, the journalists are stranded in Moria awaiting their asylum hearings. Under the European Union-Turkey deal on migrants, they can\u2019t leave the island until their cases are decided. They may face eventual deportation back to Turkey, deemed a safe third country for migrants, but a place they can\u2019t work legally. In Somalia, they would face certain danger.</br></br>In spite of all the unknowns, Adraman\u2019s ambitions haven\u2019t flagged a bit. When she can get a good internet connection at the camp, she still manages to update her website with video reports from other Somali journalists. \u201cI need to tell my people everything that\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my website to be famous.\u201d </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://globalvoices.org/2016/12/11/three-somali-journalists-on-lesbos-hope-for-the-best-asylum-in-europe/'>Global Voices</a> </br> By: Public Radio International</br> Date: December 11, 2016",

  "title" : "<h1>Olympians Without Nations: First-Ever Team of Refugees Heads to Summer Games</h1>",
  "target" : "article4",
  "content" : "<img src='pics/4_1.jpeg' width='800px'></br></br>In August of 2015, Yusra Mardini and her sister, Sarah, fled Syria after their home was destroyed in the country\u2019s civil war. The sisters traveled on land through Lebanon and Turkey, eventually boarding a boat with 18 other refugees. When that boat\u2019s motor failed in the Aegean Sea, Mardini, her sister, and another woman jumped out and pushed the boat for three hours to the island of Lesbos.</br></br>Mardini would later tell a press conference in Berlin that \u201cit would be a real shame if I drowned in the sea.\u201d Many refugees do drown attempting to reach safety in Europe\u20142,500 died this year alone\u2014but that is not what Mardini meant.</br></br>Mardini is a competitive swimmer, and she is one of 10 athletes selected this week to compete on a refugee Olympic team at the 2016 Rio Olympics. For a group of people stripped of their homes and citizenship, it\u2019s an effort to restore an element of their humanity: sports.</br></br>Prior to this year\u2019s games, Mardini and her fellow teammates would not have been eligible to participate on any Olympic team. Yet that\u2019s a violation of the Olympic Charter, which considers playing sports a human right. \u201cEvery individual,\u201d the Charter reads, \u201cmust have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind.\u201d</br></br>This is a noble value, but it raises a fundamental problem: the Olympics hold national competitions. While everyone may have a right to practice sport, not every athlete has a nation to call home. By creating the refugee Olympic team, the International Olympic Committee hopes to rectify that dilemma.</br></br>The team is composed of 10 athletes, all verified by the United Nations as holding refugee status. In addition to Mardini, there is another swimmer who left Syria, Rami Anis; two judoka from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Popole Misenga and Yolande Bukasa Mabika; marathoner Yonas Kinde from Ethiopa; and five runners formerly of South Sudan, James Nyang Chiengjiek, Yiech Pur Biel, Paulo Amotun Lokoro, Rose Nathike Lokonyen, and Anjelina Nada Lohalith.</br></br><img src='pics/4_2.jpeg' width='800px'></br></br>Team Refugee Olympic Athletes (ROA) was created by the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee in response to the global refugee crisis resulting from nearly 20 million refugees, as of 2014. Meaning the Earth now has about 1 million more refugees than there are Romanians or Syrians. In 2012, Romania sent 103 athletes to the summer Games.  </br></br>\u201cThis will be a symbol of hope for all the refugees in our world, and will make the world better aware of the magnitude of this crisis,\u201d said IOC President Thomas Bach, when he announced the final team selection. \u201cIt is also a signal to the international community that refugees are our fellow human beings and are an enrichment to society.\u201d The refugee team is funded by the Olympic Solidarity Programme, created to assist those National Committees in need of organizational resources and training support. The Solidarity Programme already supports more than 1,700 athletes from developing countries, in addition to the refugee team.</br></br>When the refugee team makes its entrance at the Opening Ceremony, it will be the first time a team will march at the Olympics representing no nation. They will march to the Olympic Anthem; they will carry the Olympic flag.</br></br>While ROA will be the first organized team to represent nationless peoples at the Games, the athletes will not be the first to participate in the Olympics without being on a national team. According to Bill Mallon, Olympic Historian and founding member of the International Society of Olympic Historians, individuals have competed in the past, usually due to war or political sanctions in their countries. The first instance was in 1992, when Yugoslav athletes, whose team was banned due to sanctions associated with the Balkan war, were allowed to compete as \u201cIndependent Olympic Athletes.\u201d</br></br>Allowing 10 refugees to compete does not mean every human population suddenly has access to the Games. There are still groups, like Tibetans, who remain in political situations that exclude them from bringing a team to the Olympics. Because of China\u2019s occupation of Tibet, Tibetan athletes must compete under the Chinese flag, if at all. But with the creation of a refugee team, it is possible to imagine a more inclusive future for the Games. Tenzing Sherap, Program Manager at the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota, praised the IOC for creating a space for refugees, and for recognizing that \u201cthese things are not about sports only but about longing for freedom.\u201d</br></br>Most refugee stories in the media focus on hardship and tragedy: dangerous mass movements, dilapidated tent cities, and refugee camps. \u201cThese are important pictures but they depersonalize the refugee story,\u201d said Bill Canny, Executive Director of Migration and Refugee Services for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cThe more that [the] Olympics can personalize, tell a personal story about a refugee and his or her family, I think it makes it more real for us to see how in fact these people differ very little from us if at all.\u201d</br></br>Given the Olympic-sized audiences Rio will bring, the stories of the refugee athletes will provide a new, powerful opportunity for those working to ameliorate the refugee crisis. The London Summer Olympics in 2012 was the most watched TV program in U.S. history. Second on that list is the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. Worldwide, the Olympics measures its viewers in billions.</br></br>This is important at a time when global public perceptions of refugees are low, the United Nations reports. In the United States, refugees have been met with disdainful public opinion, according to PEW Research. Attitudes toward immigrants are often divided along party lines, with 59 percent of citizens saying immigrants strengthen the country and 33 percent calling them a burden.</br></br>Yet the stories of refugee athletes are filled with adversity and deserve to be heard. Misenga and Mabika, the judoka from Congo, defected from their homeland when they applied for asylum during a 2013 Judo Championship tournament in Rio. Misenga fled after his mother was killed and his brother disappeared. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too much war, too much death,\u201d he says. Mabika\u2019s story is similar; her family was lost in Congolese conflict. Both turned to Judo as a way out. \u201cJudo is my life. It helped me escape war, to take another path,\u201d says Mabika.</br></br><img src='pics/4_3.jpeg' width='800px'></br></br>\u201cThe more that people understand what a refugee is and what a refugee has gone through,\u201d said Canny, \u201cI think that increasingly people in this country will welcome them, and help them start new lives in the United States.\u201d</br></br>In the meantime, the athletes will train in the nations where they have sought refuge. The South Sudanese runners are training in Nairobi, Kenya, with two-time New York City Marathon winner Tegla Loroupe. Loroupe, a three-time Olympian will also serve as the team manager for the Refugee Team. \u201cWhen I look at them, when any of us look at them, we\u2019re reminded that it isn\u2019t by choice that people become refugees,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be any of us.\u201d</br></br>Yusra Mardini practices with the support of the German National Olympic Committee (NOC). Michael Shirp, deputy head of media for the German NOC, says that Germany is proud to support Yusra and her effort to compete at the Olympics. He says she and her sister \u201crepresent an impressive example\u201d of the refugee population in Germany, which grew by more than 1 million in the past 15 months. Because refugees give up their homes and suffer through perilous journeys, Shirp says, they offer inspiration to Germans.</br></br>That inspiration and talent is evident from the Mardinis\u2019 arduous trip to Europe. At a press conference in Berlin in February, Mardini recognized the inspirational nature of her personal story. \u201cThe problem [in Syria] was the reason I am here and why I am stronger and I want to reach my goals,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cI want to inspire everyone that everyone can do what they believe in their hearts.\u201d</br></br>A global audience will hear all the stories of the refugee Olympic team this summer. And in doing so, a billion souls will get to watch the nationless compete as equals, as the Olympics lives up to one more aspect of its optimistic charter. </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/olympians-without-nations-first-ever-team-of-refugees-heads-to-summer-games-20160609'>Yes Magazine</a> </br> By: Christopher Zumski Finke</br> Date: June 9, 2016",

  "title" : "<h1>The Refugee Olympic Team: an illusion of inclusion?</h1>",
  "target" : "article5",
  "content" : "At Rio, the media were eager to define the refugee team as a 'great Olympic story' but it is quite the opposite. </br></br>The first edition of the modern Olympic Games, held in Athens in 1896, was a competition between individual athletes rather than nations or countries. Over the years, however, the Olympics has become the most spectacular projection and representation of \u2018nation states\u2019 on the global stage. Despite the inclusive and egalitarian claims of the Olympic project, stateless athletes, and even those holding more than one nationality, soon became an oxymoron. They could not fit the traditional mould and were not allowed to compete.</br></br>Nevertheless, the idea of admitting a team made up entirely of refugees is a total novelty for modern sporting mega-events. It is, to some extent, a message of \u2018inclusion\u2019, because as the IOC president Thomas Bach pointed out, the refugee team\u2019s participation could \"make the world better aware of the magnitude of this crisis\".</br></br>At the same time, however, the team is evidence of the structural inability of modern organised sports to cater for people who, for various reasons, are not citizens of a recognised state. How can someone compete at the Olympics or play in the FIFA World Football Cup if they are not \u2018nationals\u2019 of a country? If the dominant narrative around these extremely lucrative and expensive events is essentially one that sees \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019, nation versus nation, what role is left for those who do not belong?</br></br>There have been exceptions to the pattern. For example, the Yugoslav athletes who were allowed to take part in the 1992 Games in Barcelona under the Olympic flag because of the conflict plaguing their country. Another example is the individual athletes whose national Olympic committee is non-existent or banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as is the case of Ehaid Al-Deehani, the marksman from Kuwait who made history in Rio becoming the first athlete to win a gold medal as an \u2018independent athlete\u2019.</br></br>It is not simply a moral and legal problem for states and transnational organisations such as the United Nations or the European Union. It is a political issue that epitomises the way sports governing bodies, both at national and international levels, function and what their contribution to the symbolic maintenance of the national state system may be. They are the purest expression of an \"inter-state worldview\" which is inapt to address what Giorgio Agamben defines as \"a normative tension mounting within western democracies\". According to Agamben, \"what the industrialised states are faced with today is a mass of permanent resident noncitizens, who neither can be nor want to be naturalised or repatriated\". This is particularly evident in Europe.</br></br>The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that at least 680,000 people in Europe are without citizenship of any country. Children born to refugees or asylum seekers are the most exposed to this problem, as they cannot usually be attributed a nationality if their parents have lost their own or do not possess a birth certificate, as is the case, for example, for many children born in refugee camps in Africa.</br></br>Furthermore, according to Eurostat, at the end of 2015 there were about 90,000 unaccompanied minors in the European Union. \u2018Unaccompanied\u2019 means that they travelled without the presence of a parent, relative or legal guardian. In accordance with the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child, unaccompanied minors have the right to protection until they turn 18 and they should not be deported (even though very often the contrary happens, as recently admitted by the Home Office). To some extent, children are a \u2018protected\u2019 category among refugees. However, national and international sports governing bodies are not prepared to welcome them and in many cases they openly exclude them from organised sports. This is what happens in association football, the most global of sports.</br></br>According to FIFA's rules, the first registration of children who are not nationals of the country where they wish to play has to be examined by a Sub-committee within FIFA's Players' Status and Governance department, based at the organisations' headquarters in Switzerland. Over the years, FIFA has developed a body of norms aimed at the protection of minors. The objective of these norms is to prevent the trafficking of young players from 'poor' countries mainly in Europe.</br></br>These norms, while controlling and regulating the scouting of young talent across the world, have arguably reinforced the role of FIFA and national FAs as safeguards of symbolic national boundaries and identities. To this day, despite the growing number of refugee children admitted into Europe, FIFA has granted the registration to unaccompanied minors only \"on very limited occasions and with extreme reservation.\"</br></br>This is not surprising. All international sports, and particularly football, function as national sports. They are not suited to accommodate something that lays outside of their institutional scope. There are obviously exceptions, but these are reserved for the most talented among athletes and players. Many countries in Europe and across the world possess legislation to favour naturalisation on the basis of sporting merits. This could arguably happen also to the members of the refugee olympic team. It is a process of selection which reflects the function of the \"border as method\" \u2014 the border used as a filter to serve the interests of a country and, in this case, of a particular national industry such as sport.</br></br>The recent success of the UK team at the Olympics proves that governments are eager to invest large amounts of money to win medals and titles in international sport competitions. The underlying discourse, which crosses political ideologies, is that sport victories will enhance the international prestige of the country and favour its internal cohesion glorifying the \"imagined communities\" which we are made to think of as nations. If refugees are exceptional athletes, their 'integration' ought to be facilitated and even encouraged, as this could help to attain such political goals.</br></br>Global leisure industries such as the Olympic Games, the nation states who support them, and the sponsors and corporate partners that benefit from their existence, are only ready to use refugees as pawns, to create an illusion of inclusion. Their existence points to the need to re-evaluate the national(istic) ideology that surrounds and informs modern global sports, which, as it stands, mainly benefits the stronger and wealthier countries. </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.opendemocracy.net/max-mauro/refugee-team-olympics-inclusion-illusion'>openDemocracy</a> </br> By: Max Mauro</br> Date: September 25, 2016",

  "title" : "<h1>Unwanted refugees in Europe</h1>",
  "target" : "article6",
  "content" : "Conflict, persecution and starvation; these are the common factors that drive people from their homes, forcing them to make the well-nigh impossible decision to abandon their lives as they know them and seek refuge in a strange country.</br></br>The United Nations has reported that more than 60 million people are refugees. Many are in extremely difficult situations, displaced from previous or ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. The war in Syria has been the single largest driver of refugees in the world; more than four million Syrians are displaced beyond its borders. The majority have fled to neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.</br></br>For many decades Europe\u2019s borders have been under pressure as a result of economic migration; now the continent has a new phenomenon in migration, with economic, political and humanitarian reasons behind so many people knocking at the door. That is why Europe is reacting nervously to the current refugee crisis.</br></br>According to Zygmunt Bauman, a Polish sociologist: \u201cThere are two crucial values without which human life is simply inconceivable. One is of security, a measure of security, feeling safe. The other is freedom, the ability to self-assert, to do what you really would like do and so on. They are both necessary; security without freedom is slavery. Freedom without security is complete chaos, where you are lost, abandoned and you do not know what to do.\u201d</br></br>Whether in the Middle East or Africa, there is a constant lack of security and freedom that has caused ongoing conflicts. Hence, many who live there find themselves lost and incapable of acting with certainty or assurance.</br></br>Many who have fled to Europe from Syria are not fleeing from hunger but from the insane ravages of war. They are people who, yesterday, were happy and proud of their homes and their position in society; some of them are very well educated and were financially comfortable. Homes, family, jobs and positions in society have been lost or forfeited in a bid for a safer life elsewhere.</br></br>So, what of organisations such as the UN and the EU; do they have any firm solutions to this current refuge crisis? Apparently not; there is much rhetoric but no credible strategic plan to secure stability in Syria and the region.</br></br>\u201cOur increasingly divided and desperate European leaders are failing to deliver an effective collective response to the escalating refugee crisis,\u201d claims former Prime Minister of Belgium Guy Verhofstadt. \u201cInstead of devising a strategy to protect those fleeing the barbarity of Assad, Islamic State [Daesh] and the Russian air force, EU leaders are obsessed with devising a system to \u2018stem the flow\u2019; in other words, to push desperate refugees back into the Aegean sea.\u201d</br></br>The number of Syrians arriving in the EU seeking international protection continues to increase. However, their number in Europe remains low compared with the number of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries like Turkey, where almost three million are living, more than in any other country. Many Europeans believe that their own countries have taken considerably more Syrian refugees then they actually have.</br></br><img src='pics/6_2.jpg' width='600px'></br></br>Historically, Turkey has acted as a \u201chumanitarian sponge\u201d by absorbing the plight of surrounding countries and providing a safe haven for countless people, regardless of their religious, ethnic or linguistic backgrounds. \u201cHaving adopted an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees in 2011,\u201d explained President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, \u201cwe now host nearly 3 million Syrian nationals from diverse ethnic, religious and sectarian backgrounds. In the past five years Turkey has allocated $10 billion to provide Syrian refugees with free healthcare, education and housing.\u201d</br></br>Why has this crisis been so difficult for the EU to deal with? With a population of 500 million and a gross domestic product of $18 trillion, why is the EU so much less capable of dealing with a refugee crisis than Turkey, which has a GDP of $798bn and a population of 78 million? The real answers to this question would be \u201can unwillingness to face the reality\u201d and \u201cignorance of the situation in Syria.\u201d</br></br>Instead of finding a real solution to this crisis or helping people who have fled from Syria many European countries are building fences and passing ever-harsher immigration and asylum laws. As a result, violence and deaths at borders are increasing. Furthermore, many right-wing nationalist parties claim that immigration threatens Europe\u2019s national and cultural identity, even though the EU asserts that it was founded on a commitment to promote human rights and democracy.</br></br>Slovakia`s leader Robert Fico stated recently that \u201cIslam has no place in Slovakia\u201d in a direct reference to the religious background of most Syrians. He warned that \u201cmigrants change the character of our country\u201d and declared that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t allow such change to affect his nation.\u201d</br></br>Some East European countries, such as Hungary and Slovakia, have responded to refuges arriving at their border with hostility and repressive tactics that blatantly contradict EU principles. As a result, rifts have opened up between EU member states.</br></br>According to the Atlantic newspaper, one of the wealthiest residents in a Swiss village is willing to pay a fine to keep refugees out. \u201cWe do not want them here; it is as simple as that. We have worked hard all our lives and have a lovely village that we do not want spoiled. We are not suited to take in refugees; they would not fit in here.\u201d</br></br>It is clear that, for many Europeans, the prospect of becoming a minority in one\u2019s homeland is seen as a threat and they worry that an influx of refugees will dilute their country\u2019s cultural identity. Far-right nationalist parties have capitalised on these fears, mobilising an anti-immigrant and \u201canti-Islamisation\u201d agenda; as a consequence, most of the far-right parties across Europe have gained electoral support.</br></br>The recent UK referendum on whether to stay in or leave the EU resulted in a surprise \u201cleave\u201d vote. One of the most prominent \u201cleave\u201d campaigners, Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP (the United Kingdom Independence Party), positioned his party\u2019s policies to be critical of both the EU and Muslim migration. The timing of UKIP\u2019s transformation and success should come as no surprise. Like its nationalist counterparts across Europe, it uses scare-mongering tactics to attract support, playing on the people\u2019s fears.</br></br>One of the most outspoken European leaders, Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has justified his anti-immigration by saying: \u201cThose arriving have been raised in another religion, and represent a radically different culture. Most of them are not Christians, but Muslims\u2026 This is an important question, because Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity\u2026 Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian?\u2026 There is no alternative, and we have no option but to defend our borders.\u201d</br></br>In many ways the EU itsef is proof that people can learn from their past mistakes, look beyond their cultural differences and unite as one for the purpose of promoting liberal values, peace, and stability. Unfortunately, the divisive response to the refugee crisis has threatened to unravel decades of progress \u2014 and relative peace \u2014 in Europe.</br></br>The move toward nationalism and isolationism will not be the solution. That route has been used several times in the past and it leads to deeper division and cycles of destruction.  </br></br>If Europe comes together with compassion and without the fear that brings prejudice, then it can deliver an effective collective response to the escalating refugee crisis; otherwise last year\u2019s wave of immigration will not be the last. As such, the EU has to accept the situation and, moreover, must come together and find a genuinely robust, lasting solution. It is time for the world to step up and lend a helping hand in order to solve the refugee crisis. </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160805-unwanted-refugees-in-europe/'>Middle East Monitor</a> </br> By: Ferhat Polat</br> Date: August 5, 2016",

  "target" : "article7",
  "content" : "<img src='pics/7_1.jpeg' width='600px'></br></br>On disembarking from my train from Paris at Amsterdam Central Station at around 10pm, I notice a man on the platform holding up a sign that reads: \u201cWelcome. We are here to support you\u201d.</br></br>I stop and tell him I\u2019d heard they needed Arabic speakers to help with interpretation for refugees from the Middle East. The man\u2019s face lights up. He walks me to a corner of the station where food, drinks, clothes, toys and other basic needs are neatly organized, awaiting the arrival of the refugee.</br></br>I\u2018ve been living in Amsterdam for the past two months, and lately talk about refugees possibly arriving in the city has been on the rise. Anticipating that the tide would eventually spill over to the Netherlands, a group of volunteers has banded together to help refugees with their transition and move to the camps.</br></br>The group at Central Station has a schedule of arrival times, focusing on trains coming from France, Germany and Belgium that have a strong likelihood of having refugees on board.</br></br>My task is simple: greet them, chat with them, ask if they need food, water or clothes, cheer up the kids, explain what will happen next. I focus on the things I need to say and the information I shouldn't forget. What I didn\u2019t anticipate are the stories the refugees would tell me.</br></br>One after another they come, with big smiles on their faces of delight and relief that they\u2019ve finally arrived, talking over each other to relate how they\u2019d boarded the \u201cdeath boat\u201d in Turkey to get to Greece and then to the Netherlands.</br></br>Khalid, a man in his late 30s, tells me the inflatable boat he travelled on had 49 people on board, including women and children. As the vessel was overcrowded and not equipped to carry that much weight, they all had to throw their bags and belongings overboard to save their own lives. They disembarked at the Greek port of Mytilene soaking wet and shivering as Greek government officials looked on. Khalid has special praise for some Dutch tourists who quickly approached them and offered help. He remembers a woman wrapping him, cold and dripping wet, in a warm blanket.</br></br><img src='pics/7_2.jpg' width='800px'></br></br>\u201cWe were becoming discouraged on the boat,\u201d Khalid tells me. \u201cBut we drew motivation from each other. The men yelled, \u201cCome on, we can do this! We have women and children on board!\u201d And that's how we kept going.\u201d</br></br>Upon arrival at Mytilene Khalid said they had to walk over 50 kilometers, from the north of the island to the south. He points to a friend he met on the boat whom he says was sick for days after being on the water for that long.</br></br>A Syrian woman interrupts to say that their boat had in fact exploded because of the weight. \u201cWhen I remember the journey we had to take to get here, my eyes tear up,\u201d she says. She and her fellow passengers had to swim the last few meters to the shore. She, her three little boys and her husband had fled from Al Raqqa, which is now under the complete control of ISIS.</br></br>Another woman tells what they paid for a trip on the boat: 1,400 euros per person. Another family paid 4,000, which they had to borrow from people they knew. \u201cYou paid 4,000 euros to possibly die?\u201d I said to one of them. \u201cWe are dead either way in Syria,\u201d he said.</br></br>A man in his late 50s who goes by the name of Abu Shadi is eager to connect to the wifi to call his children. His daughter lives in Breda, an hour and a half south of Amsterdam. His son lives in Sweden. Once settled, Abu Shadi looks at me with a broken smile. \u201cMy family is all over the place in different countries,\u201d he says. As he looks at a photo of a young man in his early 20s on the screen of his phone, tears start pouring down his cheeks. \u201cMy son Feras has been missing for over a year now. Bashar Al Assad's forces kidnapped him. I don't even know whether he's dead or alive.\u201d</br></br>As I try to empathize with Abu Shadi's unimaginable pain and grief, I'm called to report to the ambulance parked outside, in order to help mediate between a Dutch doctor, and a 23-year old man, also named Feras, who has been complaining of an increasingly severe headache accompanied by a cough and irritating rash. Having spent weeks sleeping in on the floor in various camps, the rash has spread all over his body. It's the first time I've seen the inside of an ambulance.</br></br>I meet two Iraqi men from the city of Mosul who were captured by ISIS but managed to escape and flee the country. One, a former general, was held by ISIS for 17 days. They broke his right shoulder because he had a tattoo (taboo in Islam) of the map of Iraq, blindfolded him and tied him to a fan. The second man, Ahmed, one of 23 people captured by ISIS, says they put a knife to his throat. \u201c19 people were killed in front of us, and I was one of the survivors,\u201d Ahmed tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got out of it.\u201d</br></br><img src='pics/7_3.jpg' width='800px'></br></br>As I address these people in Arabic, they\u2019re excited to hear a familiar language and ask where I am from. I\u2019m slightly ashamed to admit I\u2019m from Bahrain, a Gulf country that contributed to the war in Syria. The Gulf nations offered nothing, and added insult to injury by shirking their responsibility to host refugees in their oil-rich countries.</br></br>And here I am now, a privileged resident of the Netherlands, studying at a top university to earn my fully funded Masters. My biggest worries are about submitting my next exam, while they\u2019re huddled together in a corner of Central station, wondering what the future has in store.</br></br>Mohammed tells me he left his wife and child back in Syria with nothing but a promise to make it to Europe and have them join him once he settles. \u201cWe don't want to be a burden on society,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a nurse. I want to learn Dutch and start working.\u201d They\u2019re humbled that we want to help and refuse to take more than the minimum that would get them through the night.</br></br>As the refugees in Central Station take in the fact that they\u2019ve arrived in Amsterdam, the kids skip around among us volunteers, enjoying their new toys. Soon, they\u2019ll all board a Red Cross bus that will take them to a temporary camp, and the start of some sort of new life. </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://globalvoices.org/2015/09/23/we-are-here-to-support-you-a-dutch-welcome-for-refugees/'>GlobalVoices</a> </br> By: Faten Bushehri</br> Date: September 23, 2015",

  "target" : "article8",
  "content" : "September is usually a calm period in Greece, as schools swing back into session, but this year's fall season has been marked by unprecedented measures taken by a parents group.</br></br>Following the government's decision to integrate more than 15,000 children from refugee and migrant families into the national education system, members of the Parents and Guardians Association of the 5th Primary School of Oreokastro in Thessaloniki declared they would not allow their children to attend classes. The group even threatened to protest the government's plan by occupying school buildings, if refugee children are allowed to enter Greek classrooms.</br></br>Critics of the parents\u2019 association say the group has embraced racism.</br></br>QUOTE: \"Oreokastro was given to refugees from Pontos back in 1922. Our grandparents were refugees, but we are racists\u2026\"</br></br>The parents\u2019 group says its main concerns are based on health risks posed by unvaccinated children from refugee families, warning that they will bring diseases into the Greek school system. Dr. Asterios Gavotsis, the mayor of Oreokastro, supports this position, staking his medical reputation on claims that refugee children carry \u201cdangerous and communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and malaria.\u201d</br></br>Parents also warn that supposedly unbridgeable linguistic, social, and cultural differences would lead to serious communication problems. Coexistence with local children, under the same school roof, is simply not an option, the association insists.</br></br>Attitudes online about the controversy are naturally mixed, with Internet users debating the issue fiercely online. Supporters of the parents\u2019 group cite the unique entitlements of citizenship, the need to keep refugees from establishing roots in Greece, and the risks of \u201cdegradation.\u201d</br></br>QUOTE: \"Whoever wants the jihadists\u2019 children to attend school instead of leaving Greece, let him teach them himself\"</br></br>User egrammes clarifies that free education is obligatory only for Greek citizens:</br></br>QUOTE: \"Free education is a state obligation granted only to Greek citizens (Constitution Article 16, par.4)\"</br></br>While user FainaretiRom firmly supports the Parents Association's actions and decisions in Oreokastro:</br></br>QUOTE: \"I wish we had 10 more [towns] like Oreokastro. Our country wouldn't have such a degradation.\"</br></br>Others, meanwhile, have condemned the racism they say is inherent in the idea that the refugee children should be turned away from Greek schools, pointing out that most people now wanting to slam the door on these people are themselves the descendants of migrants and refugees.</br></br>As a local website writes:</br></br>QUOTE: \"[\u2026] In this area, between current Paleokastro, know previously as Daout-Bali, and the edges of Asprovrysi, Ak Bournar, at the northern residential end of the current municipality, the establishment of the settlement of Pontian refugees was decided. These refugees came from the villages of Argyroupolis province, Mouzaina Tsimera, Xats, Agios Fokas, Kromni, Sourmena, Sistan, Lauria and the villages of Matsoukas. The installation process began in 1922 and ended in 1930, with the attendance of other refugees from the Pontian Stavrin and Caucasus.

  "title" : "<h1>Refugees and the European Identity: a sociological perspective</h1>",
  "target" : "article9",
  "content" : "Two years into the refugee crisis, Europe still faces a volatile situation. Turkey is threatening to scrap the agreement forged back in March 2014, which could heat a tense situation back up to boiling point.</br>Currently, millions of refugees are currently being processed within the EU, resulting in more than just logistical problems. Language barriers, economic precarity and an uncertain status for refugees have done nothing to reduce the criminality and hate crimes our societies bring against minorities and the crime, from simple fraud to sexual assault, that some migrants have brought to Europe. Are there identity-based obstacles preventing some migrants from integrating ? Are we witnessing a clash of cultures or are these events too isolated to attempt to systematise ? A quick review of some sociological interpretations of European identity may help us shed some light on these questions.</br></br><img src='pics/9_1.jpg' width='800px'></br></br><h2>The various perspectives on European identity</h2>There are various perspectives on European identity as distinct from a single identity. One of these interpretations is Paul Valery\u2019s \u2018Classical idea\u2019, which stated that European identity requires all races and all territories to be successively Romanised, Christianised and submitted to the discipline of the Greeks; people should possess Greek habits, be accustomed to the Roman legal system and have an understanding of the Christian religion. In addition, a democratic political system is important to this classical idea.</br></br>Another idea of a strictly European identity was elaborated by Karl Mannheim, who saw European identity as being part of a common culture, political, intellectual or moral condition with common customs, manners or religious traditions, regardless of the differences between people. The classical view has similarities with the view of Mannheim. But the perspective, as described by sociologist Ash Amin, is different. According to Amin, Valery\u2019s classical conception leads to despotic rule unable to govern difference without submitting it to its own understanding of reality. He argues that the current society with people from many different backgrounds, such as European and non-European, different religious backgrounds and customs should not be excluded from a modern European society. Amin is afraid that powerful persons will misuse the classical European identity to marginalize strangers as lesser citizens.</br></br><h2>European identity: a match or mismatch with the refugees?</h2>When taking the various perspectives of the European identity and placing it next to these points, it is noticeable that the immigrants are difficult to place within the classical idea of the European identity. As these immigrants are not accustomed to the roman legal system, have in most cases no understanding of the Christian religion, and are in some cases more used to despotism than real democracy. The perspective of Karl Mannheim is quite similar to the classical idea and thus also sees a cultural clash between Europeans and immigrants from outside Europe. However, the view of Ash Amin in comparison fits better with the idea of immigrants from a different background coming to live in Europe. He argued that modern Europe is a cosmopolitan Europe with various cultures and backgrounds - something that includes the Syrian refugees and other Middle-East immigrants, making them fit within the European identity.</br></br>The situation with the immigrants also created a clash between the west of the European Union and the east, an inter-European culture clash, with the west being more welcoming to refugees than the east. It might be possible that the answer to this situation can be found within the historical material analysis from Andreas Bieler. He argued that in the 90s, after the fall of the USSR, the west started with an eastern-expansion turning eastern societies into more modern liberal capitalist societies. As this only happened in the 90s. the mentality of their old \u2018society style\u2019 is still present. A mentality that is not fond of refugees of different cultures.</br></br>The recent events with the immigrants, such as rape, criminality, and harassment against minorities makes one believe that the theory of Ash Amin does not work in practice, and that the classical theory and the theory of Karl Mannheim seem more adequate to understand situation. Europe took in too large amounts of refugees, refugees that had no idea about Europe and threaten the European way of life by not adapting their values and principles to European values and principles. Nonetheless some refugees show the will to adapt to their new home and country, refugees who are always welcome. Still it is hard to decide who is willing and who is not when they come into Europe with defective boats.</br></br>In addition, Ash Amin may be right about the fact that the classical theory can increase despotism in society as it visible these days with the rise of far right parties across Europe and this while despotism is totally anti-European, showing another negative side of the current refugee crisis. </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.thenewfederalist.eu/refugees-and-integration-a-sociological-perspective'>the New Federalist</a> </br> By: Richard Haringsma</br> Date: December 29, 2016",

  "target" : "article10",
  "content" : "<img src='pics/10_1.jpg' width='800px'></br></br>\u2018You can\u2019t tell who is craziest: the refugees, the police or those women,\" said a local shopkeeper. He made a cross over his chest, to express his sincere Serbian bewilderment.</br></br>He had just witnessed ten shabby Afghan and Syrian refugees walking past, escorted by ten Women in Black from Serbia, Italy and Spain, themselves escorted by ten policemen and a police car.</br></br>By the railway station in downtown Belgrade, the temporary citizens-from-nowhere are living their nomad existences in the the rubble of the so-called Belgrade Waterfront construction project. The refugees loiter all day, hoping for something to happen, between the city bus yards and huge trash-cans full of boxed food that the aid workers supply on a regular basis.</br></br>Around five pm there is a kind of tea ceremony where about 800 people gather, most of them arriving from the organized camps where they sleep. They arrive to be heard, to be seen. We Women in Black went to join them to show this Belgrade political scene to our international colleagues.</br></br>It\u2019 s been now two years since the Syrian refugee crisis seized headlines, but the refugees are not entirely Syrians, but a global peoples\u2019 market of Afghans and Nigerians as well. In the beginning there were many more refugees, and far less aid from the locals and the Serbian state. The migrants were simply collapsing on flat surfaces anywhere in Belgrade, urban nooks, parks and lots where they ate, drank and slept.</br></br>Now the bus-station square, a favorite place to cluster for obvious reasons, has been fenced and organized. The police are everywhere and a routine has been invented for the nomads. Its scope is international: border walls are being erected around Serbia, blocking the paths into Schengen Europe, where of course the refugees long to go. They come from the perilous South, the imagine safety in the West, and Balkan Serbia is only a transit zone.</br></br>I spoke to some : they are 90 percent young men. They aspire to reach France, Germany, Italy and Spain. They have addresses and phone numbers of relatives and allies in those countries, but they have no transit papers and no money.</br></br>A Nigerian young man confided me: \"Money is the only real problem. If I had the money for travel, trust me: no walls or police could stop me.\" I believed him, because, although money cannot buy you a happy life, it can swiftly bail you out of misery, in war and in peace.</br></br>I remember how I myself smuggled chocolate into wartime Serbia from Hungary by handing cash to the customs officers. Chocolate was pure joy for Serbian children living under sanctions. The same applied to toilet paper, diesel fuel, gasoline, cigarettes, liquor...</br></br>In the nineties in Serbia, my country was being punished, but nobody thought to build walls around our national borders. On the contrary, in those heady days they built shopping malls, instant ramshackle markets that welcomed the smugglers, mostly everyday people who crossed the borders and illegally brought back suitcases stuffed with subsistence goods for a population in dire straits.</br></br>The entire economy had been de-legitimated, so we were all smugglers. The locals from countries around us made plenty of money, for their governments officially supported the sanctions while the population broke them.</br></br>Today, by historical contrast, it's Serbia is playing the warm-hearted good cop role. The former villains in the story are generously taking in the refugees, while the international community, morally pinched by the ever-growing breakdown of world-order, pays a lot of the bills. The refugees are not a novelty any more, they are escorted here and there to wherever some shred of bureaucracy or activism will take them.</br></br>The official camps were packed long ago, overcrowded with women and children, so many of the more venturesome young men end up as street vagrants, lurking under the bridges, lighting trash-fires in barrels and building makeshift showers and latrines.</br></br>I joined a Syrian group at their five o'clock tea-time. Very polite and neat brothers made us tea and poured it into genuine glasses, not plastic containers, as a sign of respect. Syrian refugees in Europe are particularly well educated, as my friend Faisa from Morocco told me: \"They are the elite.\" Here in Serbia the Syrians are the most envied by other refugees, because they are genuine war refugees and the official recognition of their dire situation is a kind of privilege.</br></br>It follows that the Syrians sometimes get roughed up in the squats for other refugees and the Belgrade police have to intervene. I asked my tea-drinking hosts, and the other young men who gathered around me: where are your women?</br></br>They could not understand my English or Italian, but they had learned some scraps of Serbian. They all knew the word \"Mamma!\" Everybody\u2019 s mamma was either back in the home country, or off in a camp. A few children were visible, but not many.</br></br>Belgrade Women in Black never come empty-handed, so they brought the useful, lightweight treats that true refugees appreciate: cigarettes and bananas. We left the covert obscurity under the bridge and began a march with some sick to the local first aid. > > The women activists walked in the center, the refugees gathered around them and the police escort formed an outer circle. A police car was a kind of cavalry escort. The Serbian police were the same age as the refugees, but with somewhat lighter skin color and in uniforms. > > I talked to the cops. \"Where are the refugee women?\" I asked. The chief answered me with a sly secretive smile: \"You noticed that fact, madame,\" he said. \"You are bright,\" he complimented me. \"Because these are men fit for army service. They came here to conquer Europe, they are on a secret Muslim jihad, they left their women safe behind!\"</br></br>When I asked the refugees the same question, they echoed the policeman's compliment: \"You are very bright madame. Our women are at home hungry, we are here to earn money to help them. But they won't let us make a living; they keep us behind the barbed wire.\"</br></br>The refugees and policemen had one great point of agreement in their paranoid stories. They knew that the same people who had destroyed their nations were the ones attacking them for being transnational. They were punished for the crime of becoming victims.</br></br>I guess they blamed the big powers, those with the power to bomb them rather than their own militias and factions, but I didn't want to inquire into the details. As a woman, as an activist, I've seen enough warfare to know its situations. It doesn't take genius to see that a war-shattered society can't integrate its men and women; the genders get scattered and there aren't a lot of women around.</br></br>Wars and refugee crises are business as usual for someone, just like the situations in stark situations in barracks, prisons, and hospitals. When there is money involved, it's human trafficking; when even the money fails, then it's sheer disaster.</br></br>I have no recipe to solve a world with 60 million refugees in it, but I see more coming. The whole planet is becoming a nomad zone, for various reasons of war, oil, climate, ethnicity, religion, and everyone, especially including the most privileged, is scared that they might be next. The one percenters who own the hot investment money are perhaps the most nomadic among us, so they cannot play the geostrategic game properly any more. Their money cannot by them any security, while the refugees were ardent patriots until their burned their neighbors homes or had them blown up from above. Utopia and dystopia have the same postal code.</br></br>So who are the craziest on the street? The refugees, women or the police? A good question, and I think I know the answer, do you? </br></br> Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://boingboing.net/2016/10/17/refugees-women-in-black-and-t.html'>Boing Boing</a> </br> By: Jasmina Tesanovic</br> Date: October 17, 2016",
